# Titanic Competition

Predicting survival outcomes from the Titanic disaster using machine learning techniques. This repository includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, data preprocessing, modeling (classification), and a Kaggle submission pipeline.


## Project Overview

This project aims to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic using various machine learning techniques. The main steps involved in this project are:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2. Feature Engineering
3. Data Preprocessing
4. Modeling (Classification)
5. Kaggle Submission Pipeline

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adil-faiyaz98/titanic-competition.git
cd titanic-competition
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Data
The dataset used in this project is the Titanic dataset available on Kaggle. It includes information about the passengers such as age, sex, class, and whether they survived the disaster.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involves understanding the data, identifying patterns, and visualizing relationships between different features. This helps in making informed decisions during feature engineering and modeling.

## Feature Engineering
Feature engineering involves creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve the performance of machine learning models. This step is crucial for building accurate predictive models.

## Modeling
Various classification algorithms are used to predict the survival of passengers. The models are evaluated based on their accuracy and other performance metrics.

## Results
The results of the models are compared and the best-performing model is selected for submission to Kaggle. The final predictions are submitted to the Kaggle competition.
